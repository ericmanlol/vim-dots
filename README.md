##### work in progress

just need a place to experiment / play around as i slowly redo it, separate
from a repo that also has non-vim stuff, ex. dotfiles

also my current vim configs in my dotfiles are flooded with too much crap :(

finally, figured that i'd semi-automate this grueling process once and for all

time to get back to basics, my G's!
